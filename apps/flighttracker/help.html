<h3>Welcome to the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) FlightTracker tool!</h3> 
This tool provides access to available flight track information for aircraft arriving and departing Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
<br>
<br>
To get started, follow these steps:
<br>
<br>
<ol class="myolclass">
<li class="myliclass">
<b>Select the type of Flight Track Information</b> you would like to display. You may only select one type of flight track information at a time:
<ul class="myulclass">
<li class="myliclass">
<b>Static Flight Tracks</b>
displays flight tracks that occurred earlier today or on previous dates.  Select a date and time interval to view tracks for a specific period then click the set button.
<li class="myliclass">
<b>Animated Flight Track Replay</b> 
replays flights in animated motion rather than static flight tracks for flights that occurred earlier today or on previous dates.  Select a date and time to start the replay then click the set button. Use the replay controls to start and stop the replay. The animation speed controls the speed of playback.
<li class="myliclass">
<b>Near Real Time Streaming</b>
continuously replays flights in animated motion.  These flights occurred approximately 15 minutes ago. Playback starts automatically. The stop/play button will stop or start the replay.
</ul>
<li class="myliclass">
<b>Search for address</b>
This feature will map the address entered. 

<li class="myliclass">
<b>Select the Map Layers</b>
you would like to view on the map along with your flight track information. You may select many layers, but keep in mind that each layer you have selected will increase the time it takes your map to draw. 

<li class="myliclass">
<b>Aircraft Display </b> 
When in animated flight track replay or near real time streaming mode this tab will allow you to change which aircraft attribute is displayed on the map.

<li class="myliclass">
<b>Advanced Query</b> 
When in replay or static mode, this dialog will allow you to narrow down the flight tracks displayed on the map. Unchecking an airport will remove all the runways for that airport on the map, even though the boxes for the individual runways remained checked. When the Truncate Tracks by Time Period option is selected, it will show only the portion of the tracks that occurred during the time period you've selected.


<li class="myliclass">
<b>The Navigate Button</b> 
will allow you to pan the viewable area on the map. Click one time on the Navigate button, then click on the map, hold your mouse button and slide your mouse to move the map. 

<li class="myliclass">
To utilize the <b>Measure Tool</b>, click once on the tool<img src="http://app.macnoise.com/jslibs/GeoExt.ux/ux/Measure/resources/images/ruler.png"> button and then click on the map where you would like to begin your measurement and drag to the second point and double-click on the end point.

<li class="myliclass">
